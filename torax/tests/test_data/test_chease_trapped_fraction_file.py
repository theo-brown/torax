"""Identical to test_iterhybrid_predictor_corrector but with the trapped
particle fraction read directly from the CHEASE geometry file
(trapped_fraction_source='FILE') instead of the Sauter analytic approximation.
The only config difference is the trapped fraction source, so this exercises
the FILE trapped fraction in the Sauter conductivity and bootstrap current
models with everything else held fixed.
